The point of this next section of code is to make the file transfer process work correctly with
any file. For no data corrpution to happen, both the client and the server need to know
the size of the file that is going to be trasnferred; which may be difficult when doing an
automated process with a file that was recently created. To get around this issue, I made it
so a text file containing both the size and the name of the file that the server is going to send is
sent before the actual file. That wasy, the client computer has access to the necessary information.
